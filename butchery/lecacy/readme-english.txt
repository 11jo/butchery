INTRODUCTION : 
///////////////////////////


The main objectif of this little mod is to add a challenging and fun fight in Firkraag's lair.

I like Baldur's Gate a lot, and I wrote this little mod (first version in 2010) to become a minimum familiar with some modding stuffs. Thanks to Freddy_Gwendo, my mod is now compatible with BG2 EE/EET/BGT/BG2 Vanilla. I have also made some improvements to the mod.


Secondary objectives are:

-Allow players to fight in a big room or large space because it is really boring and frustrating to fight in corridor, especially in in BG2.
-Difficulty level scaling : difficulty will be ajusted according to the game difficulty level which can be set in the Gameplay subsection of the Options menu. (more info later)
-Have a "butchery fight", with some spawn and respawn to spice up battles.
-Make a few non-spellcaster creatures a bit more challenging (while non cheated) using kit abilities, having proficiencies in weapons, etc.
-Have challenging and charismatic boss.
-Have 100% compatibility and optimisation with Sword Coast stratagems, items revisions.(especially potions revisions component)
-Keep 100% content of the original game. I add some things but I don't remove a single one.
-Add a bit of fun dialogues/cutscenes.
-No big loots or new magicals items. 


///////////////////////////
COMPATIBILITY NOTES :
///////////////////////////

This mod works on the following Infinity Engine games:

Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE).
The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion.
The conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

BuTcHeRy is compatible with most other WeiDU mods. 

I use vanilla scripts so expect the fight to be harder if you install SCS. You should install my mod before SCS of course.

BuTcHeRY should not be compatible with Improved Firkraag from revisited battles (don't expect a crash but an impossible fight).

Difficulty level scaling
///////////////////////////

This is the recent big improvement of this mod. I know that it can be frustrating to have a too much difficult fight or a too easy fight so this new possibility will surely be appreciated. 

The numbers and variety of opponents will be adjusted  according to the game difficulty level which can be set in the Gameplay subsection of the Options menu. These adjustments are reflected as follows:
On the "Core Rules" difficulty level : normal and decent amount of enemies (no divine or arcane enemies spellcasters)
On the "difficult" difficulty level  : a bit more enemies and especially divine/arcane enemies spellcasters are added.
On the "very difficult" difficulty level :again a bit more enemies and a evenmore divine/arcane enemies spellcasters

I warn you that even on Core Rules, the challenge should be quite difficult (especially before underdark) because this mod adress to players looking for a better challenge.

COMPONENTS : 
///////////////////////////

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component DESIGNATED number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components detect it and allows automated installers like the BiG World Setup specify component choices.


10. DrAzTiK's revisited fight vs Tazok & DigDag

I have always found the fight vs Tazok and DigDag in Firkraag's lair nothing more than a pathetic joke. Obviously, Firkaag is supposed to be an optional boss (like the shadow dragon) surely unbeatable before Underdark. All banters and interjections suppose the party want to escape in front of Firkraag without thinking twice and come back later, really later.

So I assume Tazok and DigDag are supposed to be the big vilains in Firkraag's lair and IMO the fight deserves to be a bit more challenging and fun. The fight vs Tazok and DigDag will now take place where you usually fight Firkraag.(AR1203) Don't worry you will be able to fight against Firkraag also. This component doesn't touch or tweak creatures at all except:

A new script is added to DigDag, letting him have some new dialogs and drink 2 potions before fighting.
A new script is added to Tazok, allowing him to drink 2 potions before fighting.
This component also adds some of my customs creatures and especially two fighters of my own composition. They are here to protect Tazok and DigDag during the final fight.



20. Rebalancing a few generic creatures :  

This component alters "a bit" stats, weapons, proficiencies of some generic orc and ogre fighters. Most of them have now a barbarian or berseker kit, a weapon witch suit their avatars, etc. but I often keep vanilla level.
///////
TABLEAU
///////
Except high score in STR and CONST, theses creatures have now the same features and obey the same rules as other humanoids (thac0, saves, hit point, kit bonus etc..), except they remain a bit slow, have an incredible moral and a good AC.

You will find mostly theses creatures only in Windspear Hills and Firkraag's lair.  

I didn't modify vanilla fighting scripts at all. So if you don't install SCS "Smarter general AI" component, creatures will not use kit abilities.

Of course, I am open to critics about my balance.


30. Rebalancing Tazok and Dig-Dag
In vanilla, Tazok is an ORC Level 18 standard fighter and DigDag an ORC level 12 standard fighter. This component tweak Tazok a bit (slightly better saving trown and hp,) add a Berserk Kit to DigDag, and improves their levels by one (level 19 for Tazok and level 13 for Dig Dag). It is also cosmetic. Tazok is now a half ogre again (as in BG1) while DigDag inherits the OROG CHIEFTAIN animation.
If you want Tazok to be a berseker, you should install SCS smarter general AI component. (no problem of compatibility)
Equipment, stats and proficiencies are tweaked a bit, especially DigDag's ones.
