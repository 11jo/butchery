## Overview

The main objectif of this little mod is to add a challenging and fun fight in Firkraag's lair.

I like Baldur's Gate a lot, and I wrote this mod (first version in 2010) to become a minimum familiar with some modding stuffs. Thanks to Freddy_Gwendo, the BuTcHeRy is now compatible with the Enhanced Editions. I also added a few improvements.

Secondary objectives are:

-Allow players to fight in a big room or large space because it is really boring and frustrating to fight in a corridor, especially in in BG2.
-Difficulty level scaling: difficulty will be ajusted according to the game difficulty level which can be set in the Gameplay subsection of the Options menu. (more info below).
-Have a 'butchery fight', with some spawn and respawn to spice up battles.
-Make a few non-spellcaster creatures a bit more challenging (while non cheated) using kit abilities, having proficiencies in weapons, etc.
-Have challenging and charismatic boss.
-Have 100% compatibility and optimisation with Sword Coast stratagems and Item Revisions (especially potions revisions component).
-Keep 100% content of the original game. I add a few things, but I don't remove a single one.
-Add a bit of fun dialogues and cutscenes.
-No big loots or new magical items.
